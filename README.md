# Mineralogy-by-Linear-Programming
Using incoming elemental data (as a flat table) and a user-defined library of minerals and mineral chemistry, the code runs a linear programming model to predict the mineral proportions for each row in the incoming table.
This Jupyter Notebook is designed to take elemental data exported from the Bruker software ESPRIT and subsequently converted to a wide format geochemical table (per Harraden et al, 2024, in prep).
Details and step-by-step instructions on how to use the notebook are available in the downloads.
